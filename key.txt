Response Details 2019:

    Notes regarding 2019 data:
        If a robot is listed as None in preMatchLevelRobotX, they were not on the field and therefore will not have habLineRobotX or endgameRobotX values
        Rocket scoring is from the perspective of standing on the field, inside the guardrail, looking at the rocket face
        Cargoship (bay) scoring is done with numbering of 1 to 8. Bay 1 is the closest to the center on the scoring table (near) side of the field, and continues out toward the alliance wall, toward the far side, then back toward the center of the field
